A simple todo list application completed in React. 

View the live application [here](https://brenton-j-andrews.github.io/todo_project/).

The big goal of this project was learning how to use localstorage in conjunction with React state. This was my first time using localstorage, and I had much of the project completed before adding it to the project. This lead to what I am guessing is a fairly ineffiecient program structure and slow performance. Now that I know how localstorage works, I will be more mindful when designing upcoming projects that utilize it.

I also learned how to use React's styled components library. Seems pretty simple and fairly useful!
